## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a crypto-compliance-tool integrates with major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management, breaking down the process, the technology involved, and the key benefits.

### Core Concept: The Tool as a Centralized Command Center

Think of the crypto-compliance-tool not as a standalone app, but as a **centralized command center** or "mission control" for your crypto activities. It sits *between* you and the various exchanges, aggregating data and executing commands according to the rules you set.

---

### 1. The Integration Mechanism: APIs

The entire process is built on the backbone of **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** provided by every major exchange.

*   **What are API Keys?** These are unique digital keys you generate from your exchange account (e.g., in the "API Management" section). They grant the compliance tool limited, programmatic access to your account.
*   **Two Key Types of Permissions:**
    *   **Read-Only / Data Permissions:** Allows the tool to *view* your portfolio balances, trade history, current orders, and market data. It cannot trade or withdraw.
